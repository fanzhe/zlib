### zLib - A graph C/C++ implementation

##### Main features:

* Canonical labeling (minimum dfs code) of a graph. 

* Customized breath first search on a graph. 

* Customized depth first search on a graph.

* Enumeration of all subgraphs of a graph with pre-defined size. 

* Neighborhood equivalent class of a graph.

* Subgraph isomorphism testing (Turbo + Ullmann). 

* Integration of VFLib (http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/implement/vflib/implement.shtml).

* Cyclic group based encryption scheme, a homomorphic encryption method supports both partially additions *and* multiplications.

* TBA: Independent Cascade (IC) Model, Linear Threshold (LT) Model, Monte Carlo (MC).
